        <p>With glasses.com, you can virtually try on thousands of glasses and sunglasses to see how you look from any angle in photo-realistic 3D. Try on frames from Ray-Ban, Kate Spade, Oakley, Burberry, Maui Jim and more — scaled to fit your face correctly.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="modal-header">A new way to find the perfect pair of frames</p>
        <p>The Glasses.com Virtual Try-On app is the breakthrough augmented reality app, accurately scanning a users face using their device's camera to generate a realistic face mesh. With this face mesh, combined with a library of thousands of hig-quality frame models, users are able to 'try-on' and view themselves in any pair of glasses offered by the online retailer.</p>
        <p class="modal-header">Designing for the future</p>
        <p>This new approach to augmented reality (what we like to call 'Passive AR') required a whole new approach to traditional app design, while retaining the intuitiveness of going to the store and taking a pair of frames off the shelf. We crafted a very in-depth onboarding experience that guided users intelligently and got us the best possible captures under many varying conditions.</p>
        <p class="modal-header">An award-winning experience</p>
        <p>The app was released to much acclaim and praise, remaining one of the top 100 downloaded iPad apps for over a year, and eventually winning awards at the Webbys, Communication Arts Awards, and Cannes Lions. Glasses.com is currently available for iPad, iPhone, and Android devices.</p>

        <p>The biggest challenge in designing BackWords was definitely the process of guessing an opponent's world, which on paper sounded daunting, and definitely provided quite the challenge. After settling on a color scheme that involved a variety of colors, it became clear that color and symbol drive clues helped guide players through the process, resulting in fast gameplay and quick turnaround for opponents.</p>

        <p>Visual Depictions of World War II is intended to give viewers an abundant collection of visual media that spans the entirety of the war and covers the majority of vital events.

While the intention wasn't to try and supplant factual world history, this project is meant to enhance and pique the interest of those who would otherwise gloss over the numerous books of information on the subject.</p>

With the help of some web magic, animations and vector art helped elevate what could have been a generic site to something entertaining in and of itself, properly showing off some of our games.</p>

        <p>The International Olympic Committee, or IOC, had used Mass Relevance a year prior for the Youth Olympic Games, and approached us again to create another social-based app for the “I Copy U” competition they were holding for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London. I was tasked with coming up with the visual design of the app, and discussions regarding the app’s functionality began with representative from the IOC. After a couple weeks of brainstorming and some back-and-forth, the IOC and those of us working on this project felt comfortable enough to move forward with designing and building the app.</p>
        <p class="modal-header">Giving depth to the depthless</p>
        <p>To give the app a bit more visual fidelity I incorporated an image element to give the background a bit more depth, which it lacked due to the flat elements required by the branding guidelines. We had used a more sporty typeface for our last IOC app, and for this we decided to go with something less rigid and more plain, so in the end we used Helvetica Neue. After finishing up the design, a team of developers built the app, and it was a huge success upon it’s release, exceeding the IOC’s expectations in generating social content and presence.</p>

        <p class="modal-header">The mechanics of an ever-growing city</p>
        <p>Urban Sprawl began life as a Ludum Dare entry, a contest in which teams of game developers are tasked with creating a game from scratch in 72-hours or less based on a specific theme, in this case being “Evolution.” My team, The Gaming Project, landed on the idea of an evolving city, and began to map out the specific mechanics that would be involved in gameplay. While our lead programmer started work on the mechanics, I came up with a pixel-art style utilizing a palette of reds, greens, and blues for each of the structures in order to visually differentiate them.</p>
        <p class="modal-header">Things get a bit more pixel-y</p>
        <p>After the Dare had ended, we knew Urban Sprawl had to come to mobile, and so development started on Android and iOS versions of the game. I knew that while the current artwork for the game held up for a game made in 72-hours, it would have to be updated to meet the quality users come to expect in the finest mobile titles. I started by upsizing the current structure assets to include more detail, as well as modifying the current buildings to closely match their real-world appearances. For the UI, I kept it simple, relying more on contextual pop-ups and notifiers.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Scrub is a fully-fledged concept for a social network where users could submit and view interactive short clips, allowing people to dive right to key moments in clips like a sports replay or a little bit of a rough and tumble. With its easy-to-use clip editors, making and sharing Scrubs is as easy as 1-2-3 (Seriously, it's only three steps).</p>

        </div>
        <p class="modal-header">It all starts with a problem...</p>
        <p>The idea for Scrub came when a co-worker was showing us various sports clips, but had to start over the clips to replay the key moments, and so we came up with the idea to utilize full user control of a clip, using only a finger to 'Scrub' through a video. Once the idea coalesced into a solid gameplan, I was tasked with designing and putting together a functional front end for the service.</p>
        <p class="modal-header">Editing and sharing made fun</p>
        <p>With a wealth of existing social networks to draw inspiration from, creating a compelling browsing experience took no time to develop, but paring down the headache of video editing is no easy task, and several proposals and ideas came and went from the drawing board before the current implementation came to be, ensuring as little time as possible was spent outside of browsing.</p>
