My Personal Site
==================
Selected works from my mind and fingertips, all in one place.

Created with the help of these tools
------------
- Jade (http://jade-lang.com/), a high performance template engine heavily influenced by Haml and implemented with JavaScript for node and browsers.
- LESS (http://lesscss.org/), a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques.
- JQuery (https://jquery.com/), a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
- Typekit (https://typekit.com/), a service that brings thousands of fonts from foundry partners into one source for easy use on the web
