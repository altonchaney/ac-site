      <h2>An Infographic Collection</h2>
      <h1>Social TV Infographs</h1>

    <p>This collection of infographics helped Mass Relevance promote and explain their social aggregation platform as well as gather pertinent social research data.</p>

    <p class="modal-header">Giving visual context to ones and zeroes</p>
    <p>The Mass Relevance platform provides an extremely easy way for users to gather and resyndicate social content from a variety of social networks, however for the average joe, the technical details might seem mystifying, and so I created an infographic clearly explaining the 'journey' of social content, from the source to the user's display. However, this was merely one side of the infographics I helped create for Mass Relevance.</p>
    <p class="modal-header">From technical jargon to layman speak</p>
    <p>In addition to the more technical infographs I helped create for Mass Relevance, I also made infographs gathering data on Social TV viewership which required me to research the then unknown space and create a compelling narrative that involved personifying the distinct groups of Social TV users which helped give the bland data more meaningful context.</p>
