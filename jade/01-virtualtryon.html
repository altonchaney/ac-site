    <p>With glasses.com, you can virtually try on thousands of glasses and sunglasses to see how you look from any angle in photo-realistic 3D. Try on frames from Ray-Ban, Kate Spade, Oakley, Burberry, Maui Jim and more â€” scaled to fit your face correctly.</p>

    <p class="modal-header">A new way to find the perfect pair of frames</p>
    <p>The Glasses.com Virtual Try-On app is the breakthrough augmented reality app, accurately scanning a users face using their device's camera to generate a realistic face mesh. With this face mesh, combined with a library of thousands of hig-quality frame models, users are able to 'try-on' and view themselves in any pair of glasses offered by the online retailer.</p>
    <p class="modal-header">Designing for the future</p>
    <p>This new approach to augmented reality (what we like to call 'Passive AR') required a whole new approach to traditional app design, while retaining the intuitiveness of going to the store and taking a pair of frames off the shelf. We crafted a very in-depth onboarding experience that guided users intelligently and got us the best possible captures under many varying conditions.</p>
