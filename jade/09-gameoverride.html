    <p class="modal-header">A full-fledged streaming line-up</p>
    <p>Game Override was founded in the hopes of delivering a different kind of gaming news experience, utilizing the growing videogame streaming market to give viewers a visual component to news in the form of a weekly livestream lineup, with shows airing each night of the week. As the Design Editor for Game Override, I was tasked with creating the branding for the GO brand as well as the visual look of the various show on GO's streaming channel. For the main logo, I created a identity using a face with a headset, emphasizing the streaming-heavy nature of Game Override.</p>
