            This new approach to augmented reality (what we like to call 'Passive AR') required a whole new approach to traditional app design, while retaining the intuitiveness of going to the store and taking a pair of frames off the shelf. We crafted a very in-depth onboarding experience that guided users intelligently and got us the best possible captures under many varying conditions.
