            Being a huge fan of gaming, I decided to create homages to some of my favorite titles. Each work is a collage of several in-game items used by the player, from the tools of Minecraft to the various Master Swords wielded by Link in the various Zelda titles. After several hours of laying out the collages themselves, carefully placing the items in a visually appealing way, I chose to cover the finished pieces in a two-color gradient, each related closely the the game the collage was based off of.
