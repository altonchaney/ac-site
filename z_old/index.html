              <p class="text">For this update to an early Android app made by myself and a partner, I decided to redesign the app from its current flat, static appearance, and incorporate many animating elements that make the displayed cards feel more tangible. The start menu was drastically overhauled to be more of a landing page than anything else, and so what was before a simple list of modifiers is now reduced to “Quick Play” and “Game Setup.” The original app had selectable ‘themed’ decks, and so with this update I recreated the deck selector to be primarily visual, showcasing actual decks as opposed to simply text.</p>

              <p class="text">The cards themselves haven’t changed too much in appearance, getting a minor facelift to give them a more realistic look. They do however have new animations that give them more contextual controls, with finger swiping directions relaying whether a team correctly guesses a card, or if the card is skipped. These controls make the gameplay extremely intuitive, and in the event the two swipes are not clear, a small question mark can be pressed to display on-screen directions. This new Tabuu marks a huge step in the apps creation, and also serves to show just how far we’ve come from our humble beginnings.</p>

I was tasked with coming up with the visual design of the app, and discussions regarding the app’s functionality began with representative from the IOC. After a couple weeks of brainstorming and some back-and-forth, the IOC and those of us working on this project felt comfortable enough to move forward with designing and building the app.</p>

We had used a more sporty typeface for our last IOC app, and for this we decided to go with something less rigid and more plain, so in the end we used Helvetica Neue. After finishing up the design, a team of developers built the app, and it was a huge success upon it’s release, exceeding the IOC’s expectations in generating social content and presence.</p>

              <p class="text">Urban Sprawl began life as a Ludum Dare entry, a contest in which teams of game developers are tasked with creating a game from scratch in 72-hours or less based on a specific theme, in this case being “Evolution.” My team, The Gaming Project, landed on the idea of an evolving city, and began to map out the specific mechanics that would be involved in gameplay. While our lead programmer started work on the mechanics, I came up with a pixel-art style utilizing a palette of reds, greens, and blues for each of the structures in order to visually differentiate them.</p>

I knew that while the current artwork for the game held up for a game made in 72-hours, it would have to be updated to meet the quality users come to expect in the finest mobile titles. I started by upsizing the current structure assets to include more detail, as well as modifying the current buildings to closely match their real-world appearances. For the UI, I kept it simple, relying more on contextual pop-ups and notifiers.</p>

              <p class="text">With the Nacho Cheese Doritos Locos Tacos being a huge success for Taco Bell, a new flavor was inevitable, and Taco Bell looked to get the public's opinion on what flavor they'd most like to see, and so they reached out to Mass Relevance to provide a social experience for voters within their site. For the design, I created a modular page that dyunamically changed based on the users vote, changing in color and appearance depending on what flavor the user voted for.</p>

Not long after beginning we went with a tale of love and cats, and I came up with a visually appealing pixel-based art style, which would give the game a singular aesthetic throughout the various levels the game would go through.</p>

As the Design Editor for Game Override, I was tasked with creating the branding for the GO brand as well as the visual look of the various show on GO's streaming channel. For the main logo, I created a identity using a face with a headset, emphasizing the streaming-heavy nature of Game Override.</p>

              <p class="text">Being a huge fan of gaming, I decided to create homages to some of my favorite titles. Each work is a collage of several in-game items used by the player, from the tools of Minecraft to the various Master Swords weilded by Link in the various Zelda titles. After several hours of laying out the collages themselves, carefully placing the items in a visually appealing way, I chose to cover the finished pieces in a two-color gradient, each related closely the the game the collage was based off of.</p>
